		<p class="description">The word camel comes from the Arabic word: jamal (جمل) which literally means beauty.
		Camel's hump stores up to 80 pounds of fat, which a camel can break down into water and energy when sustenance is not available.
			These humps give camels their legendary ability to travel up to 100 desert miles without water. </p>
